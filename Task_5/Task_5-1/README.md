here I took the and_example (see and_example.cpp and and_example_assembly.s for the C-Driver and ASM-Code given in the lecture Notes)

* the machine code can be found in the file a.out
* the hex-dump can be found in assembly_hexdump.hex
* the file does not include aliases, but the and operation can be replaced by machine code (uncommented in the and_example_assembly.s)
* the dissassembled file is located at dissassembled.s (the only difference is that the .size directive has been removed)
